# app-dotfiles

Terminal and CLI tool configurations including Neovim, Yazi, Zsh, Git, and Starship.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `active/` â€“ Dotfiles currently in use (symlinked using `stow`)
- `inactive/` â€“ Archived or unused dotfiles (not symlinked)
- `justfile` â€“ Task runner for setup, backup, restore, and management

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

## ðŸ“¦ Active Dotfiles

These are expected to be inside the `active/` directory:

- `bash/ â†’ ~/.bashrc`
- `zsh/ â†’ ~/.zshrc`
- `git/ â†’ ~/.gitconfig`
- `starship/ â†’ ~/.config/starship.toml`
- `nvim/ â†’ ~/.config/nvim`
- `yazi/ â†’ ~/.config/yazi`

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
just stow      # Symlink configs from active/ to the appropriate locations
just unstow    # Remove symlinks created by stow
just backup    # Save current system configs to ~/backups
just restore   # Restore backed-up configs from ~/backups
```

##ðŸ§ª Notes

 - Only configs in active/ are stowed.

 - Use inactive/ to store alternative configs without deleting them.
